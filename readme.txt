IDE integration is a faster alternative to copy pasting when using a desktop IDE to solve problems on competitive programming websites as
hackerrank, hackerrearth and codechef. It is pretty simple to use.
What it does, in a nutshell , is that usually when you write code for sites as hackerearth,hackerrank, codechef in a desktop IDE, you need to 
copy paste the code into the online editor. So this extension limits up the process in such cases to a single keystroke

After installing the extension follow these steps to use it or check out the video tutorial at http://youtu.be/OuC8s-5Ql-E

1. Download the executable for windows(for other platforms see at step 5) from here https://github.com/sktguha/ide_integration/blob/master/ide.exe?raw=true
2. Run the file ide.exe
3. Nothing will happen, except for a notification icon added to the system tray. That is ok
3. Now write code for a problem using an IDE for it such as netbeans,eclipse, codeblocks etc,
   and once you are done writing the code just press ctrl+shift+space. 
4.A prompt will be triggered in google chrome asking which tab you want to send the code to(here sending the code refers to inserting the code in the online
code editor open in that page), out of currently open , codechef.com , hackerrank.com , hackerearth.com tabs. 
Of course this implies that if one is writing code for a problem that problem needs to be open in google chrome and online code editor needs 
to be ready. And yes, google chrome needs to be set as the default browser
5. obviously this is only for windows. However only for netbeans IDE(http://www.netbeans.org/) there a plugin at https://github.com/sktguha/ide_integration/blob/master/netbeans_specific/IdeIntegration.nbm?raw=true
   Works only for java files .Installing that plugin will add a context menu option "send code to Hackerearth or Codechef or Hackerrank". clicking that option will again trigger a prompt
   in google chrome(see step 4). see this video on how to install plugins for netbeans https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZLFcGfxHKU
  
Note for codechef.com (the editor with line numbers , syntax colouring) etc needs to be active
