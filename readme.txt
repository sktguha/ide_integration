IDE integration is a faster alternative to avoid copy pasting when using a desktop IDE to solve problems on competitive programming websites 
hackerrank, hackerrearth and codechef. It is pretty simple to use.
What it does, in a nutshell , is that usually when you write code for sites as hackerearth,hackerrank, codechef in a desktop IDE, you need to 
copy paste the code into the online editor. So this extensions limits up the process in such cases to a single keystroke
After installing the extension follow these steps to use it
1. Download the exe(for other platforms see at end) from here 
2. Run the exe
3. Nothing will happen, except for a notification icon added to the taskbar. That is ok
3. Now write code for a problem and using an IDE for it such as netbeans,eclipse, codeblocks etc,
once you are done writing the code just press ctrl+shift+space. 
4.A prompt will be triggered in google chrome asking which tab you want to send the code to(here sending the code refers to inserting the code in the online
code editor open in that page), out of currently open , codechef.com,hackerrank.com,hackerearth.com tabs. 
Of course this implies that if one is writing code for a problem that problem needs to be open in google chrome and online code editor needs 
to be ready. And yes, google chrome needs to be the default browser
5. obviously this is only for windows. However only for netbeans IDE(http://www.netbeans.org/) there a plugin at https://github.com/sktguha/ide_integration/blob/master/netbeans_specific/IdeIntegration.nbm?raw=true
   Installing that plugin will add a context menu option "send code to Hackerearth or Codechef or Hackerrank". clicking that option will again trigger a prompt
   in google chrome(see step 4)
